**Project purpose: what is the main purpose of your data product?**

*My project is going to help me keep track of all of the different data streams that I have for my masters thesis. This includes how much data has been entered, who has entered data, and if there are any errors in the data.*

**Availability: How can the product be accessed? The preferred option for apps is to create a publicly accessible app on shinyapps.io. For non-interactive apps, you can publish to [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html). If you publish to one of these services, please include a link to the data product. These options may not work for every group as they do not provide storage space for local data files, and have a memory/bandwidth limit. If you cannot use shinyapps.io or Quarto Pub, please indicate why not and follow the Alternatives for sharing data products instructions below.**

*I am the only one that needs to access this product, so it will only be available on my github. The map contains locations where I am sending technicians to in the field every day and they're my responsibility, so I do not feel comfortable making it publicly accessible.*

**What data source(s) does your product use, if any? Are they publicly available? If not, indicate why not, and if it will be possible to make your product publicly available after the end of the class.**

*My product uses 7 google sheets and 2 map layers that are stored on my machine. The google sheets are available to those with the link. I do not want this data to be publicly accessible until I am ready to publish it in a journal, so it will not be publicly available after class for some time.*

**Product features: What are the main elements of your data product (tables, plots, etc.)? What questions do they answer and how do they provide insight into your data?**

*The main elements of the product are a number of messages, graphs, and maps that summarize the progress of the project. Particularly I am wondering how much data has been entered, if there are any errors in the data, and who entered the data.*

**Automation [if applicable]: How did you automate the creation and deployment of your data product? What event(s) trigger updates?**

*The document updates every night at 10pm through Github actions. I chose this time because I can tell everyone to have their data in by 10pm every night, and it gives me enough time to review the data and make plans for the next day.*

**Interactivity [if applicable]: What are the main functions/actions that the app allows the user to do? Provide brief instructions for how to carry out these main functions.**

*I didn't have any interactivity!*

**Programming challenges: What were the main programming challenges that you faced in implementing your app?** 

*The timeline was actually very difficult to format. I've never made a visualization like that before, and I did it step by step.*

***Division of labor: Who was responsible for the different aspects of your project?*** 

I did it all!

**Future work: If you had time, what additional features would you like to implement in your app?**

It would be cool to eventually have this as a shiny app once the data is published.
