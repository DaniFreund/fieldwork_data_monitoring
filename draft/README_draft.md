# Field Work Monitoring: Fall 2023

**Description of what modifications have been made:** My project is really taking shape. I've created all visualizations I want to create for the final project. I have decided to make an html document instead of a shiny app because I don't want the data that we collect every day to be published to shiny every night, and I don't really need interactivity.

**Tasks that need to be complete:** I need to automate the updates so that the html will be updated every night. I also need to clean up some of the labels in the plotly and leaflet.
